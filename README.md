## Quantize_LLMs_to_GGUF

### Overview

This repository contains code for quantizing Language Models (LMs) to the GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) file format. GGUF is a successor to GGML (GPT-Generated Model Language), specifically designed to address limitations and enhance the user experience when working with large language models like GPT.

### Contents

- `Quantize_LLMs_to_GGUF.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing code for quantizing Language Models to GGUF format.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.

### Quantize_LLMs_to_GGUF.ipynb

This notebook serves as a guide for quantizing Language Models to the GGUF format. GGUF is a file format developed to facilitate the storage and processing of large language models, particularly in the context of inference. The notebook includes the following sections:

1. Introduction to GGUF: Provides an overview of GGUF and its significance in the landscape of language model file formats, highlighting its benefits over its predecessor, GGML.
   
2. Installation: Instructions for installing necessary dependencies and setting up the environment for running the quantization process.
   
3. Quantization Process: Step-by-step instructions and code for quantizing Language Models to GGUF format. This includes loading the pre-trained model, performing quantization, and saving the model in GGUF format.
   
4. Usage and Examples: Demonstrates how to use the quantized GGUF model for inference tasks, showcasing its compatibility and efficiency.

### Usage
